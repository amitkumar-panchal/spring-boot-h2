# spring-boo-h2
This repository contains a small set up containing an integration between Spring Boot and H2 database.

We will need to import the project in any of the IDE (i.e. Eclipse, NetBeans or Intellij Idea).

H2 Console URL : http://localhost:8080/h2/

JDBL URL : jdbc:h2:~/bookstore

Username : admin

password : admin

You will see three tables (TBLUSER, TBLROLE & TBLBOOK) created and populated.
